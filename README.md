# 🐍 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp

Welcome to my journey through [Dr. Angela Yu’s 100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). This repo documents my daily progress as I build real-world Python skills — from the basics to advanced topics.

## 🚀 Why I’m Doing This

After a successful career in content, SEO, and copywriting, I’m transitioning into software development. I’m sharing this journey publicly to stay accountable, track my growth, and connect with others doing the same.

## 🗂️ What You’ll Find Here

- ✅ Daily folders with code and notes (Day01, Day02, etc.)
- 🧠 Mini-projects, practice challenges, and course exercises
- 📈 Commit history that shows progress over time

## 🎯 Goals

- Build a strong foundation in Python
- Learn object-oriented programming, automation, web dev, and more
- Push daily commits and practice writing clean, readable code

## 📅 Current Day
**Day 3 ✅** — still early, but I’m locked in and moving forward!
