# 🐍 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp

Welcome to my journey through [Dr. Angela Yu’s 100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)! This repo tracks my daily progress, reflections, and mini-projects as I work to become a job-ready Python developer.

## 📅 Current Day
Day 3 ✅

## 🔥 Why I'm Doing This
After a successful career in content and copywriting, I’m transitioning into tech — and this course is my structured path to mastery. I'm documenting everything publicly to stay accountable and show what learning *actually* looks like.

## ✅ Goals
- Build a rock-solid Python foundation
- Create 100+ mini projects
- Learn OOP, web dev, automation, and more
- Push code daily and reflect weekly

## 📂 Folder Structure
Each day has its own folder (Day01, Day02...) with code and notes.

## 🧠 Lessons So Far
- Variables, data types, and basic I/O
- Writing and running scripts
- Committing daily progress
